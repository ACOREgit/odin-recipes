<h1>Description</h1>
    <p>My mom developed this recipe after many attempts at gluten-free meatballs. We now have a delicious and healthy way to eat a food we love!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound ground turkey</li>
        <li>½ pound chicken sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>⅔ cup gluten-free bread crumbs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine ground turkey, chicken sausage, bread crumbs, basil, milk, garlic, Parmesan cheese, kosher salt, and black pepper in a bowl; mix gently with a fork. Drop mixture, about 1 1/4-inch diameter per meatball, onto the prepared baking sheet using a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
